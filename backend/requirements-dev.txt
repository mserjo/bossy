# This file includes dependencies for development and testing,
# in addition to those in requirements.txt.
# It's recommended to install these in a virtual environment.

# Testing
pytest
pytest-asyncio # For testing async code with pytest
pytest-cov # For test coverage
httpx # Already in requirements.txt, but good to have here for clarity as a dev/test tool

# Linters and Formatters
ruff # All-in-one: linter (Flake8, Pylint, etc.), formatter (like Black, isort)
black # Explicitly, even if ruff can format, some projects prefer to run black separately or have it as a pre-commit hook.
# If ruff handles formatting 만족스럽게, black може бути опціональним.

# Type Checking
mypy

# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit

# For Alembic offline mode or advanced scripting (if needed)
# python-dotenv # Already in requirements.txt, useful for loading .env in scripts

# Debugging (optional)
# ipython # Enhanced Python shell
# pdbpp # Enhanced PDB debugger

# Faker for generating mock data for tests (optional)
# Faker

# IDE integration / Stubs (optional)
# sqlalchemy-stubs # For mypy, if not sufficiently covered by SQLAlchemy 2.0's own typing
# pydantic-stubs # For mypy, if needed for Pydantic v1 (Pydantic v2 has better built-in typing)

# To install all dependencies for development:
# pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
# Or, if requirements-dev.txt includes -r requirements.txt:
# pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# Let's include the main requirements file here for simplicity.
-r requirements.txt
